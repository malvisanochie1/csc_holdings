# Notifications Page Update Implementation

## Date
2025-11-17

## Summary
Simplified the notifications experience so the page now presents only the primary "Notifications" heading and the feed itself, removing the extra subtitles and hero card. The header component now renders just the title, and the notifications feed no longer renders the introductory "Notifications Center" summary card to match the requested minimalist layout.
