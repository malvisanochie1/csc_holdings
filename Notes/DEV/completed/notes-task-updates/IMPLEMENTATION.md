# Notes Task Updates Implementation

## Date
2025-11-15

## Summary
Implemented the outstanding Notes/TASK items by adding a clear conversion-fee submission notice, renaming Bitcoin transfer copy, and wiring a country selector into the bank withdrawal form. Added the new `settings.title` field to the client store and replaced every hard-coded site name reference with the dynamic title hook. The EFT charges and entity security pin modals were rebuilt with mobile-friendly layouts, conversion error handling now surfaces toasts, and the withdrawal completion modal shows an animated success icon. Updated the transactions page headings, mobile navigation order/labels, and ran `yarn build` to verify the changes.
