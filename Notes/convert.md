we are implementing convert flow, please carefully and follow the instruction

i need a modern clean and beautiful modal, lets have it as a resuable modal as many modals wil be 
needed in this flow

1. In the user wallet listing, we have assets listing and fiat listing, for assets listing the withdraw button
should be called Convert, for fiat listing the withdraw button should be called Withdraw
check Notes/img/convert_1.png, that is the modal for convert, use the content in the modal but a very far beautiful design is needed
