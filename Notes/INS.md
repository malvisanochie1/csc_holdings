We need a lot of UX adjustment on this project, then a proper nextjs check to make no error is shown in production

1. On light mode, lets make the bg color close to white, its currently grey and shows separation from the /dashboard cards, 
on the dasboard cards lets add a little shadow on cards, mk the page bg a little white
2. The floatting chat needs to apply our theme, theme change doesnt effect properly
On mobile when click on the floating chat, it should open a side sheet, full screen to cover the mobile screen with close icon
3. On dashboard, under the Incoming Funds Reclaims listing when a record is clicked, change the url from
/dashboard/transactions/view?wallet= to /dashboard/transaction/view?wallet=
Then on the page i gave some specific instruction please follow Notes/TASK.md to implement it
4. On the /verification page, the sidebar is scrolling, which is horrible, please fix, sidebar is not suppose to scrol
remove this entire  "Secure your account" card section
5. On mobile add a padding footer on the layout, so the mobile nav is not covering items of some pages, please add a enough space
6.
